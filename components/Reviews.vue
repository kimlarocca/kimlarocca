        I have had the pleasure of working with Kim for the last year and a
        half. She is a perfectionist that will only deliver her best every time.
        As an SEO Content Manager I have worked closely with Kim on several
        projects. From implementing video on the site to optimizing Mobile to be
        responsive she is always there with efficient, streamlined solutions.
        Thinking out of the box is her specialty. I'm grateful to have worked
        with her at ToysRUs as Kim would be a tremendous asset to any team!

        Working with Kim made my time at New York Public Radio infinitely
        better! From introducing us to Vue.js so we could modernize our stack,
        taking the time to answer any technical questions or give advice on how
        to best write computed methods, she was always available without
        judgement. Kim also helped me a lot with building out my outside of work
        Vue projects when she didn't have to. Besides being an expert developer,
        she was also just a really fun and amazing person to work with and the
        team is better with her on her it.

        Kim is an absolute pleasure to work for. She is always on top of every
        project that everyone is working on, and I know if I ask her a question
        I’ll get an answer. She is a great project manager not only in that she
        makes sure every project gets done as efficiently and as well as
        possible, but also that the people doing the projects are working on
        things that they enjoy doing! She's always pushing us to do our best and
        helping us move forward in our careers and in our skill levels. Kim is a
        great boss - probably my favorite boss I've ever had :)

        I've worked closely with Kim on a daily basis on two projects so far -
        the WNYC.org/radio player redesign and re-platform, and on the
        Gothamist.com re-platform. She was the lead engineer and direct manager
        for at least one other team member also contributing to these efforts,
        and I was the project manager. <br /><br />
        When Kim first arrived, she was faced right away with some management
        and collaboration challenges she needed to address. I saw her carefully
        gather data to address these concerns tactfully and honestly, first
        searching for data to back up the discussion points she was working on.
        I also saw her observe quietly the early retrospective meetings so she
        could get an accurate understanding of other peoples' current struggles
        and triumphs. She's been very fair, and she's still good at deferring to
        other opinions when needed, allowing others the space to speak to new
        areas of responsibility and deepen their expertise.
        <br /><br />
        Kim often provides vocal support for accessibility considerations on our
        web platforms; most recently, she was able to ensure all pages on the
        Gothamist site are navigable by screen readers. She's obsessed (in a
        positive and necessary way!) with optimizing the page speed and load
        times of Gothamist.com, and recently suggested we do research with our
        advertising partner to asynchronously advertisements there and save on
        our page speed indexes. Given a goal metric, Kim is dogged about pushing
        for it in every way she can think of.
        <br /><br />
        Kim works with Product managers frequently to break down the
        implementation steps needed for features Product wants, and is good at
        speaking to the time and effort also needed to make an idea into
        reality. She's also very generous with her time for more junior
        engineers and interns who want to contribute to the Digital team's work.
        Moreover, she knows when it makes more sense to take a back seat and
        listen during discussions of systems she's less familiar with, which is
        a time saver and frequently makes my job much easier.
        <br /><br />
        Kim is great at follow through and leads by example for team members. I
        think over the course of her work replatforming Gothamist.com to the Vue
        front end framework, I had upwards of 5 behavior fixes and very
        specific, complicated modifications to Home page behavior. She was
        polite and patient, even when I had to come back with more feedback
        about something she had just thought she finished. She asked good
        questions to clarify what I expected, and her determination to get it
        right paid off!
        <br /><br />
        Since her arrival at NYPR, Kim's been able to pitch in on a variety of
        platforms, sites, and systems. She always has a can-do attitude, which
        is invaluable in situations where morale is tenuous (including the
        global pandemic we're all still navigating.) I'm excited to see what
        ideas she has for our upcoming projects, and I'm looking forward to
        continuing to work with her as we create a long-term vision for NYPR
        Digital!

        Kim built a tool for the Great Deals Stores that is easy to use and has
        been an important asset to our team. Simply put, it is awesome! The
        Great Deals store is important for our company to showcase our best
        digital promotions for Toys”R”Us and Babies”R”Us. Creating these stores
        were very time consuming until this new tool. We are now able to copy
        all our deals into spreadsheets that can easily be loaded into the
        system. We can generate test links that look exactly like the deal
        stores, and can manipulate the dates to see time specific deals fall in
        and out of the store – a feature that is very necessary for tracking our
        deals during season. The GDS tool has been great for our team, has
        prevented us from waking up at 6am every morning to check the deals and
        has fostered trust in our team that the stores will go live every week.

        I reported to Kim during my time at iMedia Inc as a front-end developer.
        Prior to Kim joining, the front end team lacked structure and process,
        each developer using different tools to get the job done without
        receiving full requirements. Within a few weeks Kim won over everyone on
        the team and got us on track with a consistent process and framework in
        Vue.js. Even as a new hire she was not afraid to break the status quo
        and held developers as well as project managers accountable for
        following the process and ensuring work was broken up into consumable
        pieces. She led by example and wrote initial components, made an effort
        to check in daily, and offered code reviews at any time. Kim made our
        team feel confident in our work and our ability to deliver, increasing
        our productivity while lowering the stress level. It was a pleasure
        working with Kim, she is a true leader and would be an asset on any
        team!

        It didn’t take long to see that Kim is one of those leaders that makes a
        meaningful and long lasting impact not only on the team she leads but on
        any project she works on. She is very knowledgeable and resourceful but
        what sets her apart from anyone else I’ve worked with is her ability to
        lead by example, encourage and motivate her team to take any task at
        hand and use it to learn and improve their skill sets. The impression

        You rarely come across standout talent like Kim. I have worked closely
        with Kim during her time at iMedia as Lead Web Developer. She came to
        the front end team where there wasn’t any structure or process in place.
        With a couple of weeks, she quickly changed that around and had everyone
        follow a method for each project moving forward. She had helped complete
        projects on a timely matter and keeping the stress levels low. She also
        knowledgable and closely follows the new trends in the web development
        world. Apart from all the projects she works on, she held weekly lunch &
        learn to show anyone interested in learning about VueJS. The best thing
        about Kim is her relaxed attitude and sense of humor coming to work a
        pleasure. She the best manager I ever had, and anyone who works with her
        is lucky.

        Exuberant, supportive and motivating. Those are the words that I would
        use to describe Kim and her role at W2O Group, where I have reported to
        her for over 2 years. <br /><br />
        I've watched Kim define her role as Senior Director of Development and
        give that title true meaning. I've been privileged to witness her taking
        the time to instruct junior members on language constructs, code
        quality, navigating the workplace or any of a myriad other tasks, all of
        which she does with patience and grace, never too busy to help someone
        out. She has also proven herself adept and willing to jump on any task
        and get 'elbow deep' into whatever project needs to get done, regardless
        of the time frame or effort involved. Often times, this willingness
        means coding herself, facilitating others or simply providing moral
        support. She has also proven an adept and capable manager, fighting for
        her team as a whole or individuals in particular, with conviction and
        the knowledge to defend them admirably.
        <br /><br />
        Aside from her coding and managerial skills, Kim brings a cohesiveness
        and humanity to the office which is welcome and very much appreciated.
        She is always first with a smile and greeting and eager to generate
        camaraderie and promote team building during and after hours.
        <br /><br />
        I'm more than happy to recommend Kim, for any position and would

        Having worked in the consulting and project management fields I was
        expecting my transition into a traditional development role to be a very
        challenging process. Thanks to Kim, my move into software development
        was anything but difficult. As Director of Development for my team at
        W2O, Kim not only encouraged me but empowered me to really grow and
        sharpen my skills as a developer. Whether it was taking time to
        personally review my code and suggest how it can be improved, providing
        lunch and learns on how to use developer tools efficiently or
        encouraging our team to get certifications and be our tutor for them,
        Kim has always been there to push us to do our best. <br /><br />
        Yet, it's not just development that Kim has helped me grow in. Having a
        background in project management and business development, Kim
        encouraged me to really look at my strengths beyond development and find
        a way to use them to bring value to the team. Kim has always been open
        to hearing out my ideas on how to better communicate and improve
        processes between different teams and then work various groups to
        execute them. In this way, Kim asks me to look beyond just my code to
        improve a project and grow beyond just being a good software engineer.
        <br /><br />
        Simply put, if you are looking for someone who is more than just a great
        developer, but a great evangelist and leader, look no further than Kim
        Larocca. She is the person you can count on to lead, motivate, and make
        sure that your team not only makes it to the finish line of any
        technical project but truly grow on the way there.

        I have closely worked with Kim for the last three years and have seen
        her deliver day in and day out. Kim has an affinity for solving business
        problems and pushing the boundaries on every project that she is
        assigned to. Kim was our Sr. Developer where she diligently managed and
        developed all of the modular and object-oriented frameworks utilized by
        the rest of the team. Kim's raw talent in development has allowed her to
        be the best developer of the team where she constantly perfected her
        craft. Simply put, Kim was my go-to-developer for many of the larger
        Toys"R" Us initiatives that needed to be developed in a time crunch.
        <br /><br />The 2016 Big Book Toy Finder, for example, came down to the
        wire and it was only possible because of Kim's development efforts. Her
        tenacious mindset towards the project ensured that it launched on time
        while wearing many hats from the backend tool that ingested the data, to
        the front-end code that powered the web application. This experience
        generated more than 5.2M which surpassed everyone's expectations.
        <br /><br />
        There are many great things I can say about Kim and her impeccable work
        ethic. She is a hard worker, team player, team builder, knowledgeable
        and overall a well-rounded developer. I highly recommend Kim as she is a
        rockstar!!!
